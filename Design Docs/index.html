					<h2>Project Description</h2>
					<p>
						A multiplayer co-op (up to 4 players) bullet-hell game where the players work together to take down enemies.
						However the players can only attack by absorbing energy from the enemy bullet.
					</p>

					<h2>User Experience / Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
					<p>
						The user should be able to create/join rooms and start a game.<br><br>

						During gameplay the user should be able to move in a 2D space, use special abilities and a method to deal 
						damage to the enemy. Users can use special abilities by gaining enough energy, by getting close to the 
						enemy bullets, and then activating it by pressing a key. Players can also level up by gaining energy and 
						will have a set stat gain based on the players class. Each player will have a basic attack. This attack 
						can only be done by entering an player attack circle and then hitting a key. After attacking the circle 
						will dissappear and then reappear again, close to the player, after some time has passed. <br><br>

						The general concept will be similar to the original Bullet Absorber game I created. However, the turn-based
						system is removed and the player attack and enemy attack are combinded.<br>
